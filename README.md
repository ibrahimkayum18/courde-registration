# Project Features

- All carts added using API 
- You can select only one course at a time
- You can select multiple different courses 
- You can see the total budget of the courses you selected
- You can't select any course after credit hours exceed 20 hours or remaining credit hours below 0 hours.


## Implementation

- First I added cart from a JSON data. There is a button called "select", in this button I've added an event handler which is responsible for adding the courses and show the remaining time, total time and total cost of the selected courses.
